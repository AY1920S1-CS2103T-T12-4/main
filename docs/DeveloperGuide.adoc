== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same question as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CategoryListPane`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FlashCardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DeadlineListPane` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashCard).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<FlashCard>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Category` list in `Address Book`, which `FlashCard` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Category` object per unique `Category`, instead of each `Flashcard` needing their own `Category` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author shutingy
// tag::addflashcard[]
=== Add feature
==== Implementation

The add feature allows the user to add flashcard with compulsory field of `QUESTION` and `ANSWER`.
 `RATING` and `CATEGORY` are optional fields which the user can add to the flashcard later using the `edit` feature.

[NOTE]
Following are the prefixes for each field: +
- q> : `QUESTION` +
- a> : `ANSWER` +
- r> : `RATING` +
- c> : `CATEGORY`

Given below is an example usage scenario of `add` :

The user executes `add q>1+1 a>2 c>math` to add new flashcard.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]


The add feature does not allow adding of duplicate flashcards.
If the flashcard exits in the storage, an error will be shown.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

image::AddActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement add

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Use command `add` together with
prefixes like `q>`, `a>`, `r>` and `c>`
** pros: Easier to implement.
** cons: User might miss the prefixes hence adding wrong flashcards
* **Alternative 2:** Make use of the GUI. after user execute `add` command,
 an **add flash card window** would pop up and there is segment for individual fields.
** pros: More user friendly.
** cons: Harder to implement.

=== Exporting of FlashCards
==== Implementation


The `FlashCard` exporting mechanism is primarily facilitated by the following classes:

* `ExportUtil` -- Handles the actual exporting of `FlashCards`
* `ExportCommand` -- Embodies an `export` command by the user; carries information about which `FlashCards` are to be exported, and to where
* `ExportCommandParser` -- Parses user input and uses it to construct an `ExportCommand` instance

The mechanism is also supported by the package `seedu.address.model.export`, consisting of the following classes:

* `DocumentPath` -- Represents the path to a specific document - either absolute or relative to the application directory
* `DocumentFilePath` -- Represents the path to a specific document, relative to its immediate parent directory
* `DirectoryPath` -- Represents the path to a specific directory - either absolute or relative to the application directory

Of particular note is `ExportUtil`, as it is arguably the class responsible for doing the most tangible work.
Similar to the other classes in the `util` package, it consists entirely of `static` methods, and does not keep track of any variables.
It exposes a single method, `ExportUtil#exportFlashCards(List<FlashCard>, DocumentPath)`, which prints a `List` of `FlashCards` to a `.docx`
document located at the given `DocumentPath`. This is done by interfacing with the Apache POI library (in particular, the package
`org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel`).

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an export command:

image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[width=320,height=480]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Method of obtaining desired `FlashCards` for exporting

* **Alternative 1:** Update the `Model` to show all desired `FlashCards`, then export all of said >`FlashCards`
** Pros: Is easy to implement as it makes use of existing logic in `Model`; user receives immediate visual feedback regarding which specific >`FlashCards` were exported
** Cons: May cause confusion - `export` command does not imply that the selected >`FlashCards` will also be shown to the user
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a new method in `Model` that returns the selected >`FlashCards`, without updating the on-screen list
** Pros: Will not cause confusion to user - `export` command does exactly what one would expect it to do
** Cons: Is harder to implement and might result in duplication of logic

===== Aspect: Export file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Export to a `.docx` file
** Pros: Is easy and convenient to print for use as a cheat sheet
** Cons: Requires an external library due to the nature of the file format
* **Alternative 2:** Export to a `.txt` file
** Pros: Is easier to implement; the Java standard libraries already have the ability to write to text files
** Cons: Might give rise to inconvenience in printing, as most text editors (e.g. Notepad, Vim, Gedit) do not have built-in printing functionality

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
