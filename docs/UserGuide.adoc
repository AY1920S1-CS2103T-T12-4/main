== Introduction

KeyboardFlashCards (KFC) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to study using flashcards.
More importantly, it is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, KFC
can help you manage your flashcards much more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? You should be! KFC is perfect for NUS Computing students. We even have additional
features not available with most flashcard managers that we're sure you'll love.
Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest build keyboardflashcards.jar link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T12-4/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your KFC app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add >QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter. The command format would thus be as such: `add q>1+1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `q>QUESTION [c>CATEGORY]` can be used as `q>1+1 c>math` or as `q>1+1`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be inserted zero or more times e.g. `[c>CATEGORY]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `c>math`, `c>math c>school` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q>QUESTION a>ANSWER`, `a>ANSWER q>QUESTION` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

*Q*: How will the program know the correct answer to the questions? +
*A*: You have to key in the answer manually when you create the question - it’s similar to a real set of flashcards.

*Q*: How does the reminder system work? +
*A*: You select a category and a date, and the program will remind you to revise that category when the date comes.

*Q*: How will the program know if my answer is good or bad? +
*A*: It doesn’t know - you have to decide for yourself whether you are satisfied with your answer.

*Q*: Will I be able to resume the test from where I left off after I have stopped? +
*A*: No. The program does not support that.

*Q*: Can I undo the commands that I have entered? +
*A*: No. However, a confirmation will be displayed before any potentially-hard-to-reverse actions are done.

*Q*: Can I change the category of a flashcard? +
*A*: Yes, it will be one of the fields you can change when you edit the flashcard. Do note that after you change the category, you will have to refer to it using its new category and ID.

*Q*: Can I use my mouse to interact with the user interface? +
*A*: Yes, but only to a very small extent, like closing the window. This application is targeted primarily at keyboard users.

*Q*: What if I forget the format of a command’s arguments? +
