== About the project

This project was part of an assignment for a second year software engineering module (2103T) offered by the National University of Singapore (NUS). The assignment required my team which consists of 5 members to morph an Address Book application (which manages contact information of people) to suit our newly identified users, within a period of 6 weeks.

The target user group that we have selected are software engineering students like ourselves, who are more familiar and prefer to use a Command Line. As students, we take multiple modules each semester and in doing so, it can be difficult to organize notes for revision. Thus, we decided to provide a single platform for software engineering students to organize their learning resources into flashcards with each flashcard consisting of a question, an answer, and a rating.

This is what the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of our application looks like.

My role in the team was to design and write the codes for the statistics and help features which uses the commands `stats` and `help` respectively. I will go into more detail about my contributions to the project in the following sections.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added a statistics feature.
** *What it does:* It allows the user to view three different types of statistics in a single pop-up window. The statistics are displayed in the form of two bar charts and a line chart. The first bar chart shows the number of FlashCards that are rated as good, hard and easy. The second bar chart shows the number of FlashCards (good, hard and easy) that are completed during the test mode. Lastly, the line chart shows the performance of the user, displayed in percentage format. The performance takes into consideration the ratings of the FlashCards. If there are greater number of FlashCards rated as good or easy, the performance shown will be higher.
** *Justification:* This feature improves the product significantly because a user would not have to painstakingly keep track of the number of FlashCards that have ratings. The user can also identify if his/her knowledge has improved after each test, which is a good indication of exam readiness.
** *Highlights:* This enhancement required a synchronisation between the test mode and the statistics feature itself. The test mode was completed by another one of my team members. This made it harder to integrate my feature since it required an in-depth understanding of how the test mode works. This also required me to add codes within the framework of the test mode feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Modified the exisiting help feature.
** *What it does:* It displays a full list of commands that are supported by our application, instead of providing a url to the user that directs him/her back to the user guide page.
** *Justification:* My experience with the help feature in various applications led me to believe that providing a url link back to the user guide does not serve a good purpose. If the user is just looking for the list of commands available, then it would be a time-consuming process.
