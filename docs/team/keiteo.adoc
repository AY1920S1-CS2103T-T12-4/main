== PROJECT: KeyboardFlashCards

== Introduction

This project portfolio highlights the contributions I have made for my project, _KeyboardFlashCards_ (KFC).
Done as a major part of our introductory software engineering module in the National University of Singapore,
we started off by morphing an address book application into our very own product,
a flashcard manager that is purely controlled using the Command-Line Interface (CLI). This is the key constraint of the
project, as users can only perform tasks by typing commands on the keyboard.
exclusively using the keyboard. In addition, this is a desktop application, used only on a computer.

This is a 6 week software engineering project, where we worked in a team of 5 who are students from the NUS School of Computing.
Our team consists of 3 second year students majoring in Computer Science, including myself, and 2 Computer Engineering students in their final year of study.

Our finalised product, _KeyboardFlashCards_ is a educational tool that aims to make remembering things easy, while at the
same time helping our users, computing students familiar with the CLI, to save time with simple and quick keyboard commands. We wanted
to provide an efficient way to study for our peers to NUS School of Computing. Hence, we came up with an easy to use,
flashcard manager using CLI for efficient and quick storage of important revision material to aid their study.

KFC enables users the manage their list of flashcards efficiently, via commands such as adding, deleting and editing.
The application also features a test mode where the users can choose from a list of categories to include when testing themselves.
Subsequently, based on test results, KFC tracks the users' performances and provides data visualisation based on test statistics. In addition,
the application enables users to store tasks with deadlines, e.g. reminders to study before a test, and reminding users to test flashcards
that they were not able to answer in previous tests. Lastly, KFC allows users to import and export their list of flashcards easily.
