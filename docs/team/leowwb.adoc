== Introduction
My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic CLI (command-line interface)
desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph it into a flashcard manager application,
titled _KeyboardFlashCards_. This enhanced application is targeted at computing students (in particular, NUS School of Computing
students), who will be able to use it to enhance their learning. It does this by simulating a real deck of flashcards, complete with the
standard functionality that you'd expect from an actual, physical deck (including creation, editing, deletion, and revision of flashcards).
This application has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has roughly 16 KLoC.

Here is a screenshot of our project:

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section is a summary of the contributions I have made to the team project. It includes code, documentation, and other various helpful contributions._
|===

* *Major enhancement #1*: I added *the ability to export flashcards*.
** What it does: It allows the user to save a subset of their flashcards to a specified external file. The format of the file is inferred from the specified file extension, and hence can be determined by the user.
** Justification: This feature greatly improves the application, as the ability to export flashcards would mean that the user can easily generate cheat sheets or share flashcards with others.
** Highlights: This enhancement was designed in such a way as to maximize extensibility in the future (if a developer wishes to add support for more file formats). It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging due to the dependence on an external library, as well as the tendency of certain file paths to break our parser.
** Credits: All writing of flashcards to `.docx` format is done with the use of Apache POI.

* *Major enhancement #2*: old king cole was a merry old soul and a merry old soul was he
** What it does: It allows the user to save a subset of their flashcards to a specified external file. The format of file is inferred from the specified file extension.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user .
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
